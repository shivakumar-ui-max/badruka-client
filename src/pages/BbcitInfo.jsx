            In 1950, a proposal for establishing a Commerce college in Hindi
            medium was mooted by Raja Bankatlal Badruka and Sri Pannalal Pittie.
            Nawab Ali Yawar Jung Bahadurji, the then Vice-Chancellor of Osmania
            University appreciated the initiative and suggested that a college
            be started in English or Urdu medium with an endowment fund of Rs.
            2.5 lakhs. Raja Bankatlalji, true to his character, spontaneously
            donated the amount and obtained the approval to start a college with
            Intermediate Section in English medium. The first exclusive
            institution for students of Commerce came into existence on 2nd
            August 1950. It was inaugurated by the renowned celebrity Sri M. K.
            Vellodi, ICS, the then Chancellor of Osmania University.
